# Inmoov-Upper-Extremity
SELF CONTROLLED UPPER EXTREMITY FOR EXPLORATION OF OPEN SOURCE PROSTHESIS 

This code is intended to explore the open source robot INMOOV using its right upper extremity.
Various methods of controlling the servos i.e. actuation of limbs and fingers are located 
on the bot and control glove. A schematic has been provided for replication and exploration. 
Arduino Nano and Arduino IDE 1.8.7 was used with this code.

This project was done as an Undergraduate in the Electronics Engineering Technology -Mechatronics at Quinsigamond Community College
with Professor/Advisor James Heffernan and Professor Michael Meagher

Various other codes from other sources where used to explore various methods of control, 
but may not be included in the runner. For example, HC-05 blue tooth code was not used in main.
Thank you to all who contributed and maid code available for this project.
