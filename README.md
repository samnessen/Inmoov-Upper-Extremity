# Inmoov-Upper-Extremity
SELF CONTROLLED UPPER EXTREMITY FOR EXPLORATION OF OPEN SOURCE PROSTHESIS 

This code is intended to explore the open source robot INMOOV as its upper extremity.
Various methods of controlling the servos are located both on robots arm and glove.
A schematic has been provided for replication and exploration. 
Arduino Nano micro controller and Arduino IDE 1.8.7 was used for this code.

This project was done as a Undergarde in the Electronics Engeneering Technology at Quinsigamond Community College
with Advisor James Heffernan and Professor Michael Meagher

Various other codes from other sources was used to explore various methods of controll, 
but may not be included in the final code. For example, HC-05 bluetooth code was not used in main.
Thank you to all who contributed and maid code available for this project.
